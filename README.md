# Solo web application project - May 10th, 2023

*This is a work in progress, features, tools and specifications are subject to change*

**Tools currently used:**
 - Express/Node server
 - Webpack development React server
 - Sqlite3 (Will most likely switch in future)

**Brief Description:**  
- I will be making a recipe web application; it will allow for users to create/share/modify recipes. After the web application is set and done, I will also develop a mobile application.
 
**Some features:**
 - A recipe will include fields for the following:
	 - Ingredients
	 - Preparation instructions
	 - Cost
	 - Type of diet
	 - Category of meal (Snack/Lunch/Breakfast/Dinner)
  - Recipes can be searched for by category / diet / cost / ect.
  - User profiles
	  - Should be able to modify their own recipes


**Extra features in the future:**
 - Bookmark / Favorite recipes 
 - Users will have a reputation system for how much feedback they
   receive on their recipes
	 - At a certain reputation may have the chance to earn advertisement revenue when others visit their page
  - Allow for sharing of recipes over social media platforms
  - API for recipes to be imported into third party applications
  - ~~Session variables stored in database, for potential scale issues~~
  - Containerize using docker
  - Add api to upload images within a recipe to external site (Will most likely use imgur)
